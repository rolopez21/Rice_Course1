# Plotting a Visual Takeover

Your company has recently adopted a new digital dashboard initiative that is aiming to convert all existing company reports to reports that include interactive hvPlot visualizations. The CIO firmly believes that adding interactive visualizations will help users of the report glean more insight from the data they're working with.

The CIO also believes the company is falling behind  in terms of reporting paradigms; while there are new and flashy visualization technologies out there, the company has mostly been using Matplotlib. It's time for an upgrade.

Open the [starter file](Unsolved/Core/plotting_visual_takeover.ipynb) and code the following steps. The visualizations created below should use the starter data provided in the notebook.
