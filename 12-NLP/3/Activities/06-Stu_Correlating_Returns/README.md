# Correlating Returns

In this activity, you will create a sentiment index from News API headlines and correlate it to Apple (AAPL) daily returns, looking for text topics that generate the highest correlation.

## Instructions

* Download returns data for the past month for AAPL.  
* Get news headlines for at least five topics of your choice and apply sentiment analysis to the headlines. 
* Correlate the headlines' sentiment to S&P 500 returns for each topic. Which one had the highest correlation?

## Hint

* In order to correlate sentiment and returns, we need to make sure that they're grouped in the same unit—in this case, trading days. 

* The function that you need to download news headlines is already defined. You'll need to modify it to get headlines for the days you want to include.
