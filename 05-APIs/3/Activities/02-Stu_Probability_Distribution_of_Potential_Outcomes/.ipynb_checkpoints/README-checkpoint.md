# Free Throw Simulation

In this activity, a coach wants to assess the long-term performance of one of his players when it comes to free throws. The player has a free throw accuracy of approximately `70%` and therefore makes on average `7` free throws for every `10` shots. The coach wants to know the likelihood of the player making `9-10` free throws in a single session.

Create a Monte Carlo simulation with `1000` simulations of `10` free throws to analyze the player's frequency distribution of made free throws and the corresponding probability distribution of made free throws to determine the likelihood of the player making `9-10` free throws in a session.

## Instructions

* Using the starter file provided, walk through the following steps.

  * Import libraries and dependencies

  * Write a Monte Carlo simulation that loops through `10` free throws for every simulation of `1000` simulations and saves the results:

    * Set variables for the desired number of simulations and free throws.

    * Create a list `throw` consisting of the strings `made` and `missed`

    * Create an empty `pandas` DataFrame to hold the results of each simulation.

    * Create a nested for loop to loop through `10` free throws for every simulation of `1000` simulations.

    * Use the `choice` function from the `random` class of the `numpy` library to randomly choose between the list elements `made` and `missed` of the `throw` list. Use the `p` parameter for the `choice` function to specify the probabilities of making a free throw and missing a free throw; set the `p` parameter to `[0.7,0.3]`.

    * Append the results to the DataFrame, with each column set as the series of free throw results for every simulation.

  * Loop through every column of the DataFrame and use the `value_counts` function to count the number of made free throws per simulation. Select only the values of the `made` key from the Series object that the `value_counts` function returns. Save results to another DataFrame.

  * Create a frequency distribution histogram from the DataFrame of made free throws per simulation. Make sure to manually set the bin edges using the `bin` parameter.

  * Create a probability distribution histrogram from the DataFrame of made free throws per simulation. Set the `density` parameter to `True`.

  * Using the probability distribution histogram, assess the likelihood of the player making `9-10` free throws in a single session (results may vary with each run of the program).
