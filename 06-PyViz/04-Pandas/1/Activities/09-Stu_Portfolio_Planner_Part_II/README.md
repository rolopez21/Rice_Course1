# Portfolio Planner, Part 2

Harold has been asked to revisit the 10 stocks that were researched in Part 1 of this activity: 

* Bank of New York Mellon (BK)
* Diamondback Energy (FANG)
* Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)
* Southwest Airlines Co (LUV)
* Micron Technologies (MU)
* Nike (NKE)
* Starbucks (SBUX)
* AT&T (T)
* Western Digital (WDC)
* Westrock (WRK)

Specifically, upper management wants Harold to go beyond just evaluating stocks by volatility/risk and create a more optimized portfolio with the following characteristics:

* Equal-weighted allocations

* Only noncorrelated stocks

* Only positive return-to-risk ratio stocks (Sharpe ratios)

Then, they want to visualize the returns of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in such a constructed portfolio over time, as well as how such a portfolio compares to $10,000 investments in less optimized portfolios.

Use the Pandas library to help Harold construct an optimized portfolio of stocks, and then plot and compare the returns of a $10,000 investment in the portfolio over time to less optimized portfolios.

## Instructions

Using the starter file, complete the following steps:

1. Reset the DataFrame for daily returns of the 10 stocks. Use the `pct_change` function to calculate and reassign a new DataFrame of daily returns.

2. Use the `corr` function and the `heatmap` function from the `seaborn` library to calculate and visualize the stock return correlations for each stock pair.

3. Drop highly correlated stocks and keep only noncorrelated stocks from the DataFrame (two stocks should be dropped).

4. Use the `mean` and `std` functions to calculate the annualized Sharpe ratio and assess the reward-to-risk ratio of the noncorrelated stocks.

5. Drop stocks with negative Sharpe ratios from the DataFrame (three stocks should be dropped).

6. Assess the investment potential of a noncorrelated (diversified) and return-to-risk (Sharpe ratio) optimized portfolio:

    * Set an equal weight for each stock in the optimized portfolio (five stocks). Use the `dot` function to multiply weights by each stock's daily returns to output the optimized portfolio's daily returns.

    * Calculate the optimized portfolio's cumulative returns, and then multiply the initial investment of $10,000 against the portfolio's series of cumulative returns. Plot the trend.

7. Assess the investment potential of a noncorrelated (diversified) portfolio:

    * Set an equal weight for each stock in a noncorrelated stock portfolio (eight stocks). Use the `dot` function to multiply weights by each stock's daily returns to output the noncorrelated stock portfolio's daily returns.

    * Calculate the noncorrelated stock portfolio's cumulative returns, and then multiply the initial investment of $10,000 against the portfolio's series of cumulative returns. Plot the trend.

8. Assess the investment potential of the original unoptimized portfolio:

    * Set an equal weight for each stock in an unoptimized portfolio (all 10 stocks). Use the `dot` function to multiply weights by each stock's daily returns to output the unoptimized portfolio's daily returns.

    * Calculate the unoptimized stock portfolio's cumulative returns, and then multiply the initial investment of `$10,000` against the portfolio's series of cumulative returns. Plot the trend.

9. Overlay the investment trend of every portfolio on a single chart, including the portfolio constructed in Part 1.

## Hint

Breathe easy! Take this activity one step at a time. Remember that this is the culminating activity of the unit. Think about the bigger picture in terms of what makes a particular stock portfolio a good investment.
