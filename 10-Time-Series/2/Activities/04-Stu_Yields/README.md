# Yields

## Instructions

You are given a dataset on [yields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(finance)). 

Create an ARMA model of the data. 

In order to do so, you will first need to determine whether the time series is stationary. Does the plot suggest stationarity? If it is non-stationary, make the necessary transformations.

Then create ACF and PACF plots. Can you use either of these plots to determine the lag to use for the ARMA model. 

Finally, create an ARMA model and note its p-value for the lags, as well as AIC and BIC. The order of the model should be p=1, q=1. Plot the predicted values for the next 5 (business) days.
