# A Cartographer's Expedition

Harold's birthday is right around the corner! In addition to wanting to go to New York City, he has a demand: No one can bring a cellphone. Harold wants everyone present and in the moment, undistracted by technology. He will bring his phone, but it will only be used for emergencies.

Everyone's complaining about having to navigate the city without a GPS, but Harold is unrelenting. He wants to do the trek old school. Thinking about it, you realize that using an actual map might be pretty cool.

Instead of spending money on a map of NYC, become a true, modern cartographer and create interactive map plots that can be used by you and your friends to get the lay of the city.

Work in teams of two or three people to

1. Identify six to eight locations to visit

2. Use Plotly Express and Mapbox to plot routes (point A to point B to point C) for the expedition.

### Instructions

1. Read in the `harold_bday_plans.csv` data file.

2. Slice data for your **arriving airport** and the **first** location the group will visit.

3. Now plot a course to the **second** location. Continue to plot the courses until you've included six to eight locations.

4. Once you have three points on one map, create another map and plot the next set of locations.

5. Plot all locations on one map.

### Challenge

If there are places in NYC that you'd like to visit and you know their geospatial details (latitude and longitude), feel free to add them to the data file. Be careful not to corrupt the data file.

If you do corrupt the file, re-download the data from Git and start again.
