# Categorical Property Evaluation

On August 1, Alleghany County released its 2019 real estate property assessment report. Read in the data using Pandas and plot it using a **parallel categories** plot to analyze the attributes that have a large impact on evaluated housing prices. Interact with the plot to identify key trends and patterns in each dimension.

If you finish early, complete the challenge section. If you're feeling confident in your story, volunteer to present your findings and lead the activity review module.

1. Open the starter file, and slice `prop_assessments` DataFrame by **LOCALTOTAL**, **USEDESC**, **TOTALROOMS**, **BEDROOMS**, and **FULLBATHS**.

2. Use the parallel categories function to plot the data. Color code the lines based off of the LOCALTOTAL field. Hint: Make sure to include the `dimensions` and `color` attributes.

3. Sort the plot so that BEDROOMS**, **TOTALROOMS, and FULLBATHS are sorted in ascending order.

4. Explore the data and try to spot various trends or patterns in the data.
