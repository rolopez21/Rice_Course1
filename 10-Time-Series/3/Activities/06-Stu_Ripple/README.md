# Ripple Volatility

## Instructions

Use Scikit-Learn to create a linear regression model, with the closing price returns as the dependent variable, and one-day lagged returns as the independent variable.

Using the training ("in-sample") dataset, estimate a sklearn regression model with XRP returns as the dependent variable, and XRP lagged returns (lagged one day) as the independent variable. Plot the predicted values of the testing set.

Apply your fitted model to the test ("out-of-sample") dataset. Then plot the predicted values of the testing set.

Compute the RMSE of in-sample and out-of-sample results. How does the model perform out-of-sample (on data that it has never seen before)? Are the predictions as good as, better, or worse than those that were observed for the training dataset?
