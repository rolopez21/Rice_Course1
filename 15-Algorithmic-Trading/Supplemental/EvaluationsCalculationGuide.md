### Downside Deviation/Return

The measure of risk for returns that are below the minimal acceptable return. Downside deviation is calculated similar to standard deviation; however, deviation is only focused on returns that are less than the minimum acceptable return.

### Sortino Ratio

The quotient of harmful volatility and overall volatility. The Sortino ratio focuses on downside deviation rather than standard deviation.
