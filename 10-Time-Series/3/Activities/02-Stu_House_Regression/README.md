* Create a scatter plot of the number of rooms vs. the house price.

* Create a linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.

* Fit the model to the data.

* Make predictions and save the results in a variable called `predicted_y_values`

* Plot the line of best fit along with the data (see starter code for instructions)

* Obtain the slope and the y-intercept, and r-square values of the model.
