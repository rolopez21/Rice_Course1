# Notes to the Interviewer

Each interview problem in the [Interview Questions README](../README.md) has its own README, replete with Prompts and notes specific to the problem.

Because all candidates are different people, who think and express themselves differently, it's impossible to provide a "canonical" or "exemplary" response for each interview question. Strong candidates might discuss problems in compelling ways that such reference answers wouldn't anticipate, so there is always a certain element of subjectivity in evaluating how well a candidate has done. Remember, this is ultimately an _organic_ discussion between you and your candidate. Use the README to supplement that discussion, but don't be afraid to ignore or add to the prompts and hints.

## How to Use the READMEs

* The interviewer should review the question, the prompts, and the solutions prior to beginning the interview process.

  * This ensures that the interviewer understands how the prompts relate to the solution.

  * Each prompt contains a suggestion as to when the interviewer should use it—i.e., in the Implementation Discussion or Restate the Problem steps. These are simply suggestions—feel free to use prompts whenever they are appropriate.

  * Interviewers do _not_ need to use all the prompts. Use them to guide candidates who are struggling or to introduce edge cases if the candidate is doing well.

* When a README contains a code snippet in the Problem statement at the top, do _not_ provide it to the candidate in code on the computer. Rather, write it in a notebook or on the whiteboard, and provide it to them to brainstorm with. Avoid the text editor until you have given the candidate the go-ahead to implement their solutions.

* Keep in mind that evaluation is subjective. The READMEs contain useful information, prompts, and hints that often come up when candidates are solving problems, but aren't, and can't be, _completely_ comprehensive.

  * Use the README to supplement and guide your discussion with your candidate, _not_ as a final reference for how to discuss the problem.

## Guidelines for Evaluating Candidates

* Candidates should talk through each step outlined in `HowToInterviewWell.pdf`.

  * If a problem does not lend itself to one of the steps—e.g., you give the candidate a true or false question and there is no implementation step—they should talk through each step that is relevant. Use your judgment in determining which steps these are.

* Candidates should explain their solutions _before_ writing any code.

  * Candidates should also be in the habit of asking the interviewer if their solution sketch is "on the right track" before they start implementing. Remind them to do this if they forget to do this.

* In the best case, candidates won't need _any_ prompts.

  * Don't penalize candidates if they need prompts but use the information well. But, do reward them if they do _not_ need the prompts.

* Candidates who answer the prompts _before you ask them_ are performing well.

  * The prompts are designed to bring candidates' attention to important facets of the question. If they identify these concerns independently, you should reward them in your evaluation.

* Don't be afraid to help the candidate if they need it.

  * Feel free to help candidates to an arbitrary extent. But, factor the amount of help they need into your evaluation of their performance.
