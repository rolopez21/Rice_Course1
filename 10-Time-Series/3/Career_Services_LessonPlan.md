# Career Services Resume Lesson Plan

### Instructor Notes

In this lesson, students will design a resume specific to the FinTech industry. After viewing a set of FinTech resume templates of varying skill levels, students will have the opportunity to update their resumes to showcase their new FinTech experience and skills.

**Prepare the students:** Prior to the start of this lesson, the Student Success Manager  will have a note in their weekly email that will remind students that they will be working on their resume in class. This note will tell them to bring their most current resume, preferably in the form of a Google Doc.

**A note on skill diversity:** The FinTech student demographic is highly diverse. It consists of students with a high degree of financial background, students with some programming experience, and students with little or no experience in either field. Because of this, it is important to acknowledge all of these skill levels in the classroom. Understanding the student landscape will help you better guide students in picking which resume template they should use.

Students can be divided into the following profiles:

* **Entry-level (no experience):** An entry-level student will be a student who is taking this course to break into the FinTech industry and no work experience. Their background will have nothing to do with FinTech. The work that they are doing in this class is the only work that they can put on their resume to get a job in the FinTech industry.

* **Mid-level (no experience):** A mid-level student with no experience will be a student who has worked in a different industry, but their experience has nothing to do with the FinTech industry.

* **Mid-level (relevant experience):** A mid-level student with experience will be a student who has worked in the FinTech industry and took this course in order to gain specific skills that can either advance their career or fill gaps in their knowledge. This student will have seven years or less in the FinTech or data industries.

* **Senior level (no experience):** A senior-level candidate with no experience will be a candidate who has 10 years or more of experience in a different industry but no relevant FinTech (in-field) experience.

* **Senior level (relevant experience):** A senior-level candidate with in-field experience will need to incorporate skills that they learned in the classroom to their resume.

All students should submit their completed resume to a profile coach on BCS by the end of the 30-minute session. If students do not complete their resume on time, tell them to submit their resume to BCS by the end of the week. This allows students to get feedback on the work they have done. Profile coaches should respond to students within 96 hours with feedback on their resume.

Completing a resume in class will make students **employer-ready**, which means that students will be completing the bare minimum requirements to get a job.

### Instructor Do: Which Resume Is Best? (5 min)

For the next part of class students will be working on their resumes. Their resumes will help them become employer-ready. Employer-ready means students will be doing the bare minimum of what is required for them to get a job in the FinTech industry.

Before this class, students were told that they would be working on resumes in class. If they brought a resume that needs to be updated, they can use that resume to do this activity. If they would like to start from scratch, they are welcome to use a resume template. They can also use the resume template to guide changes they need to make to their current resume.

Students need to assess who they are in the FinTech industry. Explain the different kinds of personas to students and then give them direction on what they should do in order to complete this activity.

* **Entry level (no experience):** An entry-level student will be a student who is taking this course to break into the FinTech industry with no work experience. Their background will have nothing to do with FinTech. The work that they are doing in this class is the only work that they can put on their resume to get a job in the FinTech industry. They should use the entry-level/mid-level (no experience) template to either make a new resume or to incorporate components into their previous resume that might be missing.

* **Mid-level (no experience):** A mid-level student with no experience will be a student who has worked in a different industry before but their experience has nothing to do with the FinTech industry. They should use the entry-level/
mid-level (no experience) template to either make a new resume or incorporate components into their previous resume that might be missing.

* **Mid-level (relevant experience):** A mid-level student with experience will be a student who has worked in the FinTech industry and took this course to gain specific skills that can either advance their career or fill gaps in their knowledge. This student will have seven years of experience or less in the FinTech or data industries. They should use the mid-level (experience) template to either add to their existing resume or to start scratch.

* **Senior level (no experience):** A senior-level candidate with no experience will be a candidate who has 10 years or more experience in a different industry but no relevant FinTech (in-field) experience. This student should use the senior level (no experience) template to either update their existing resume or to create a new resume.

* **Senior level (experience):** A senior-level candidate with in-field experience will need to incorporate skills that they learned in the classroom to their resume. This student should use the senior level (experience) template to either update their existing resume or to create a new resume.

Students will use these categories to determine which type of resume fits their level of experience. They will then have 25 minutes to build a new resume that reflects that experience.

Remind students that resume templates are employer-driven, meaning that employers look for these specific components on a resume when hiring FinTech candidates. Because of this, it is important that students have these components on their resume before submitting.

### Student Activity: Resume Building (25 min)

**Files:** [FinTech Resume Templates](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p2IaA5qybg1W71B8eRhDw74INZ_FAXfuSTdpQHqUFTs/edit?usp=sharing)

Have a TA slack out the FinTech resume templates. Students should identify the kind of candidate they will be and pick a template accordingly.

In this activity, students will have 25 minutes to create or update an existing resume. Students should be creating their resume in a Google Doc and should not submit a resume in PDF format. If they do submit their resume as a PDF, their profile coach cannot give feedback. Make sure that all students change the settings on their document to give their profile coach edit access.

After students complete their resume they should submit it on BCS so they can receive feedback from a profile coach within 48 hours.
