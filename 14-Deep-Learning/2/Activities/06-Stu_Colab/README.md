# Deep Learning on the Web

In this activity you will use the text classification demo notebook to understand and modify a deep learning classification model with Colab.

## Instructions

* Work with a person next to you for this activity.

* Read through the [ _Text classification with movie reviews_ notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0rc/site/en/r2/tutorials/keras/basic_text_classification.ipynb) completely.

* Take turns explaining to each other what each code block is doing and make sure that you both concur.

* In the _Build the model_ section, experiment with the neural network architecture defined to increase the accuracy of the model and decrease loss to the maximum extent possible.
