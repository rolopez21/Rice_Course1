# Counter

In this activity, you will create a function that preprocesses and outputs a list of the most common words in a corpus.

## Instructions

* Create a function that takes in a list of documents and outputs a DataFrame that contains the 10 most frequent (preprocessed) words in the list documents. 
* Create a similar function that outputs the 10 most frequent bigrams in the list of documents.
* Run both functions on the corpus of Reuters articles that has been prepared.

## Hint

* Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary where the keys are not column names can be tricky. One way of doing so involves using the items() function of the dictionary. Use Google to your advantage if you're having trouble implementing this part!
