# Trading Functions

Tony, an aspiring trader, wants to invest his money in the stock market. His colleagues and friends all tell him that his best bet is to invest his money in a mutual fund and hold for the long-term. While Tony admits investing in the long-term is indeed the safest bet, Tony is fascinated with short-term market swings and wants to profit off of such market fluctuations. Unfortunately for him, Tony has a 9 to 5 day job that prevents him from constantly monitoring his short-term investments. Therefore, one night, while thinking of how to maximize his profits while minimizing his risk, he undergoes an epiphany and realizes he needs to create JARVIS (Just Another Research Visualization and Investment Service) to monitor his investments *for* him. Not knowing where exactly to start, Tony goes to the drawing board to figure out what operations JARVIS should perform. He starts jotting some ideas down but now needs to piece everything in a cohesive manner.

Help Tony decide what the correct order of the below functions should be called and why.

## Instructions

Open the [unsolved file](Unsolved/jarvis_v1.py) and complete the `main()` function by calling each function below in an order that might make a trade:

* evaluate_metrics()

* generate_signal()

* fetch_data()

* build_dashboard()

* update_dashboard()

* execute_backtest()

* initialize()

* execute_trade_strategy()

### Hints

Imagine that each function had complete code and the data was all connected. Which order would make it possible to make a complete trade?
