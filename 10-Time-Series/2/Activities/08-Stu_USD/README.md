## Instructions

In this activity, you will use GARCH to forecast volatility of the Euro-USD exchange rate.

Create a GARCH model whose order is `p=2`, `q=2`.

Output the model summary. Take note of the p-values. Are any of them significant (<0.05)?

Plot the annualized results.

Forecast Horizon: Create a five-day forecast of EUR to USD exchange rate volatility using the last day of the dataset as the start parameter.

Annualize the forecast from the step above for interpretability.

Plot the forecast of the annual EUR to USD volatility over the next five days.

Is risk expected to increase or decrease over the next five days?
